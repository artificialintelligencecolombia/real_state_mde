# =======================
# Conda Fundamentals
# =======================

# Conda is an open-source package manager and environment management
# system.
# Keeping Anaconda in the home directory can sometimes aid in
# portability. If the home directory is backed up or moved, the
# Anaconda installation and all its environments move with it.

# -----------------------
# Environment Management
# -----------------------

# Create a new environment with a specific Python version:
# conda create --name <env_name> python=<python_version>
# conda create --name <env_name> 

# Activate an environment:
# conda activate <env_name>

# Deactivate the currently active environment:
# conda deactivate

# List all available environments:
# conda env list

# Remove an environment:
# conda env remove --name <env_name>

# Clone an environment:
# conda create --name <new_env_name> --clone <existing_env_name>

# Export an environment to a YAML file:
# conda env export > environment.yml

# Create an environment from a YAML file:
# conda env create -f environment.yml

# -----------------------
# Package Management
# -----------------------

# Install a package:
# conda install <package_name>

# Install multiple packages:
# conda install <package1> <package2>

# Search for a package:
# conda search <package_name>

# Update a specific package:
# conda update <package_name>

# Update all packages in the current environment:
# conda update --all

# Remove a package:
# conda remove <package_name>

# List installed packages:
# conda list

# -----------------------
# Channels and Configurations
# -----------------------

# Conda packages are organized in repositories called channels.
# By default, packages are fetched from the main channel, but other channels like conda-forge are popular.

# Install a package from a specific channel:
# conda install <package_name> --channel <channel_name>

# Add a channel (makes it a permanent source for packages):
# conda config --add channels <channel_name>

# Display conda configuration:
# conda config --show

# -----------------------
# Miscellaneous Commands
# -----------------------

# Update conda itself:
# conda update conda

# Clean up unused packages and caches to free space:
# conda clean --all

# Display information about the current conda installation:
# conda info
